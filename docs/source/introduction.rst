Main features
=============

*clif* contains code to perform climate fingerprinting, i.e. principal component analysis of climate data, and a collection of preprocessing scripts for xarray DataArrays. We use a templated OOP approach so that all classes can be seemlessly integrated with the transform operator in scikit-learn. [#]_ 

For a guide on how to use the EOF class and the preprocessing transforms see the :ref:`EOF API <api_fp>` and :ref:`Preprocessing API <preprocessing_transforms_api>`
